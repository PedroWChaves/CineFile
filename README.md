Work in progress for a Random Movie selector

It will contain a user inserted list of movies (year and title) that, through the IMDB API, will complete de information (duration, image, genres, etc)
The app will have the option to organize the movies in various ways and select a random one with or without priorities

In the future, it will have the option to have many movies lists simultaneously, as well as share with other users (with or without permission to make changes to the list)
